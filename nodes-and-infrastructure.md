# 1) Focus of analysis (pick 2 poles)

## Most **sensitive** (analyze first, always): **N — Inter-Agent Communication (protocol bus)**

**Why:** it’s the single point where coupling, trust, and flow meet. Any slop here (schema drift, replay/injection, missing idempotency, unbounded fan-out, weak ACLs) cascades across *every* other pattern—tools, memory, planning, even guardrails. It’s also where latency/throughput trade-offs hide deadlocks and silent drops.
**What to harden first:**

* Canonical message schema + versioning (JSON Schema or Protobuf), strict validation.
* Idempotency keys, TTLs, retries with backoff, DLQs; per-topic rate limits.
* Topic isolation (public vs privileged), signed/encrypted payloads, per-topic RBAC.
* Backpressure & flow control (don’t let parallelizers starve evaluators).
* Deterministic correlation (trace IDs) so E&M can reconstruct causality.

## Most **stable / resilient** (anchor under turbulence): **P — Prioritization (ranking/queues)**

**Why:** prioritization degrades gracefully. With a sane queue + scoring rule, you can throttle, shed load, or reorder without breaking semantics. Even when LLM variance spikes or tools flake, P can keep the system coherent: what runs, when, and at what budget. It’s the last, simple lever that keeps the ship pointed.
**Make it anti-fragile:**

* Deterministic score: `priority = (value / cost) * freshness * safety_factor`.
* Multi-queue (high/med/low) + aging to avoid starvation.
* Budget-aware admission control (ties into O — Resource-Aware Optimization).
* Policy hooks so R/K/L can force-drop or escalate before work starts.

> If you wanted the “most *central*” rather than the most sensitive: **Q — Evaluation & Monitoring** is the gravitational center. But for *risk*, N is where the bombs go off; for *stability*, P is the keel.

# 2) Minimal-overhead stack for a **dynamic agentic architecture**

**Goal:** n8n as the human-legible orchestrator; add the thinnest possible bones for bus, memory, safety, and metrics. All dockerized; runs locally or on a single VPS.

**Core picks (lean + proven):**

* **n8n** — orchestration, approvals (L), runbooks, simple tool glue.
* **Redis** (Streams + Pub/Sub) — the **N bus** (fast, zero-friction, great for backpressure).
* **Postgres** — durable state (plans/goals/checkpoints, J/F) + audit trail.
* **Qdrant** — vector memory (H/M) with minimal ops; swap to sqlite-based LanceDB if you want zero services.
* **LiteLLM** — one-file LLM gateway (routes to OpenAI/Anthropic/local), easy quotas & logs; keeps **E** sane.
* **OpenTelemetry → Prometheus + Grafana** — **Q** in practice (latency, error rates, topic depths, success criteria).
* **(Optional) Temporal.io** — if you need exactly-once, long-running sagas and rock-solid retries. If not, skip to keep it light.

**Why not heavier stuff?**

* Kafka/NATS add ops overhead you don’t need at this scale—Redis Streams are enough.
* Full LangChain stacks can bloat; use **LangGraph** only if you want explicit agent graphs inside code. Otherwise, let n8n own the graph.

**How they map to the 20 patterns:**

* **N (bus)** = Redis Streams topics (`plan.*`, `tool.*`, `eval.*`, `safety.*`).
* **P/F/J/O** = Postgres tables + n8n workflows (admission rules, budgets).
* **H/M** = Qdrant + retrieval functions; hydrate contexts, enforce source tags.
* **E** = LiteLLM + tool shims (HTTP nodes in n8n).
* **Q/R/K/L** = OTel metrics + policy nodes; n8n approvals for escalations.

**Bare-bones docker-compose services (conceptual list):**

* `n8n`, `redis`, `postgres`, `qdrant`, `litellm`, `otel-collector`, `prometheus`, `grafana`
  *(add `temporal`, `temporal-ui` only if you need it)*

**Guardrails with low friction:**

* **Policy layer:** Cerbos or OPA (lightweight) to enforce “who can run what tool with which params”.
* **Payload filters:** JSON Schema validation nodes in n8n on ingress/egress.
* **Evals:** simple rule-based checks first (regex/thresholds) → LLM evals only when needed.

## TL;DR — your two compass points

* **Watch like a hawk:** **N — Inter-Agent Communication** (protocol bus).
* **Lean on for stability:** **P — Prioritization** (queues + ranking).

**Stack:** *n8n + Redis Streams + Postgres + Qdrant + LiteLLM + OTel/Prometheus/Grafana* (Temporal optional).
This gives you an agentic backbone that’s fast to stand up, easy to reason about, and resilient when things get weird.
